# sfrconnect

Autoconnect to SFR hotspot.


# Configuration

Just set the variables "user" and "password" at the begining of the file.


# Requirements

I try to write less possible specific to bash code, so it should work with every shell, but I don't test it with something else than bash.

So you need sh (let me known if it don't work with your shell), wget, sed and grep.
